Researches are down regarding the market composition of the motorcycle industry, including the brand composition, OEM and supply Chain, Customer composition, and government regulation. Two Questionnaires targetting separately towards general customer and motorcycle lovers are created to investigate the brand recognition, experience from existing and potential customers.

The report is delivered in four parts:
* Value and Significance of motorcycles in the future
* Customer preference shift towards diversity (towards diverse brand and high-volumn emission motocycles)
* Motorcycle business enters the new era (customer-centered experience and e-commerce becomes the trending mode for sale)
